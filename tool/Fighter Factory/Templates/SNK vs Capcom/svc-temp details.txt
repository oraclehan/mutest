       ---- svc-temp ----
-----------------
This is a template character based on the SvC style of gameplay.
Modified from Ragnarok and Kitsune's MEE template, it is pre-packaged
with the following:

- Maximum system
- Exceed system
- Guard Cancel system
- Guard CounterAttack
- Guard Crush system
- Collapse state
- Dizzy system
- Extra anim groups for SvC custom states in air file.


Feel free to use for your own purposes. Here are a few things you need
to keep in mind:

- View the example Dm and Exceed commands to see how to properly set
the Maximum bar and exceed vars. 
- The Cheese Kill only functions when you are beaten while blocking in
a standing state. Mugen will treat being beat in air or while crouching
as it normally does.
- The dash's length is also determined by the animtime of the animation
itself, as well as the run speed mentioned in the cns file.
- For the enemy taunt to add power, they must use state 195 as their taunt
state. Mind you, that is the same as KFM, and a very common one, but there
are always a few exceptions.

I'd like to thank the various people that have helped with the creation of
this, from Orochi, Sander, and XGarg who helped directly with clearing up coding
issues, to various betatesters From Dev and Rev who helped to point out
what I had overlooked. All your help is greatly appreciated.
